          .col-xl-8
            p The online cosmetics store decided to switch from the previous cumulative discount system for regular customers to a new bonus system. The current system of cumulative incentives calculated 5 levels of discounts depending on the volume of purchases separately for retail and wholesale customers. Of the 211,237 customers, 31,965 used cumulative discounts.
            p The client wanted regular retail customers to have the same discounts (but the level no longer increased) and to have the opportunity to switch to a new bonus system. And all new customers simply have to join the bonus program automatically.

            p The existing accumulation program worked on the basis of a built-in CMS module, for which there was no documentation. The discount accumulated by the client was not reflected anywhere, and it was impossible to disable its effect, leaving the buyerâ€™s savings at the same level.
            p The number of bonuses for a product, accrual parameters, write-off of bonuses - everything should be managed through 1C. And the site playing a secondary role should also have access to bonuses, without waiting for a response from 1c, and without violating the integrity of the bonus system.

            h2.ui-title-inner How
              span.text-primary  we did it
            p We collected all possible parameters of apartments and divided them into groups, defining categories for developing filters that the user can operate. In total there were 150 parameters and 8 groups. The system was designed so that a new selection parameter could be added at any time.
            p For each parameter we chose 3 weighting coefficients. Maximum - if the system considers the parameters important for the client (those that he himself selected in the filter), average weight - for those dependent on the selected parameters, minimum - for all others.
            p We used the Apache Solr search engine, which allows you to quickly perform operations on large databases. Additionally, it passes functions as fields for selecting and sorting. As a result, tests on the operation of the engine using a sample of 15,000 apartments for various sets of filters showed the output speed within 120-150 ms.

        .ui-label As a result
        .lead
          span.text-primary The client received
          |  super-fast catalog filter that generates a selection based on the most important parameters in less than 1 second. And we got another satisfied client!
